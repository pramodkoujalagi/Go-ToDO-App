The Go to-do list program works like this:

1. Initialization: Initializes an empty to-do list.
2. User Loop: Continuously interacts with the user.
3. Menu Display: Presents options - Add Task, View Tasks, Quit.
4. User Input: Awaits user choice (1, 2, or 3).
5. Switch Statement: Utilizes a 'switch' statement to handle different user choices.
6. Add Task: If the user selects (1), appends a task to the list.
7. View Tasks: If the user selects (2), shows the current tasks.
8. Quit: If the user selects (3), terminates the program.
9. Invalid Choice Handling: Requests a valid choice in case of an error.
10. Loop Continuation: Repeats until the user chooses to quit.
11. Termination: Prints a goodbye message and exits the program.
